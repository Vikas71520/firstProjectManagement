# firstProjectManagement

The GitHub project management feature is highly engaging as it allows us to set and track milestones effectively. For example, if we have 4-5 milestones to complete a project, we can add them in GitHub and monitor progress toward each goal. One of the most useful features is the ability to create and track issues, which can be associated with specific milestones. This helps in organizing and addressing any problems that arise in the code or project efficiently.

Additionally, the project boards are particularly interesting because they allow us to organize tasks visually. We can create lists such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," and move tasks between these lists as the project progresses. This makes it easier to track the status of each task, ensuring that nothing is missed and everything is accounted for. Overall, these features provide a clear and organized approach to project management, improving collaboration and workflow
